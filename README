== ABOUT ======================================================================

these are the how to programs for the inhesion cellular genetic programming
library.

for more information on inhesion, go to http://inhesion.com/.

== BUILDING ===================================================================

to build these programs, set the environment variable $IH to the location of
your inhesion library.  for example, if you checked out inhesion into
/home/clownfysh/ih, then set IH=/home/clownfysh/ih.  that will tell the how to
programs which inhesion library to build against.

once you've done that, just type "make".
